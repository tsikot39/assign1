        Hi! I'm John, a Full-Stack Engineer. I build web applications from start
        to finish. A full-stack engineer is responsible for designing,
        implementing, and maintaining both the front-end and back-end components
        of web applications. I'm responsible for developing the client-side
        (front-end) components of web applications. This involves writing HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript code to create responsive and user-friendly
        interfaces that interact with users. They work on implementing the
        visual design, layout, and interactivity of web pages, ensuring a smooth
        and intuitive user experience. I'm also responsible for developing the
        server-side (back-end) components of web applications. This involves
        writing server-side code using programming languages such as Python,
        Node.js, Ruby, or Java, as well as working with databases, APIs, and
        other server-side technologies. They implement the business logic, data
        processing, authentication, authorization, and other server-side
        functionalities required by the application. I'm often responsible for
        designing and managing databases used by web applications. This includes
        designing database schemas, writing SQL queries, optimizing database
        performance, ensuring data integrity and security, and handling data
        migration and scaling as the application grows.
